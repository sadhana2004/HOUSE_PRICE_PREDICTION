# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
Overview
This project involves predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about house features and their sale prices.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

.numpy
.pandas
.scikit-learn
.matplotlib
.seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

Prepare the dataset:
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the Jupyter notebook for EDA and model training:
jupyter notebook notebooks/house_price_prediction.ipynb

Results:
The Jupyter notebook contains cells for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. Check the final cell for model performance metrics and predictions.
