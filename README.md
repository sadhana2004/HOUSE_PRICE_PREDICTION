# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

#Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. This project leverages Kaggle's Housing Prices Competition dataset to build and evaluate predictive models, providing insights into the factors influencing house prices.

#Features
Predict house prices using machine learning models.
Handle missing data and encode categorical variables.
Utilize XGBoost for model training and evaluation.
Create a pipeline for preprocessing and model training.

#Installation
Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

#Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pip (Python package manager)

#Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/house-price-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd house-price-prediction

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
To predict house prices, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your data in the same format as the Kaggle dataset.
2. Run the model training script:
python train_model.py
3. Use the trained model to make predictions:
python predict_prices.py --input data.csv --output results.csv

#Example
python predict_prices.py --input new_houses.csv --output predictions.csv

#Configuration
config.json: Configuration file for model parameters and file paths.
